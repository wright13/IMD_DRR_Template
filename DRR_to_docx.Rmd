# Data Records (required)

## Data inputs (optional)
If the data package being described was generated based on one or more pre-existing datasets, cite those datasets here.

## Summary of datasets created (required)

The Data Records section should be used to explain each data record associated with this work (for instance, a data package), including the DOI indicating where this information is stored, and provide an overview of the data files and their formats. Each external data record should be cited. Below is some sample text:

This DRR describes the data package `r dataPackageTitle` which contains a metadata file and `r length(dataPackage_fileNames)` data files. These data were compiled by the National Park Service Biological Resources Division and are available at `r dataPackageDOI` (see Table 1).

```{r FileTable, echo=FALSE}
filelist <- data.frame(dataPackage_fileNames, dataPackage_fileSizes, dataPackage_fileDescript)

knitr::kable(filelist, caption = paste0("**", dataPackageTitle, ": List of data files**"), col.names = c("File Name", "Size", "Description"), format = "pandoc")
```

See Appendix for additional notes and examples.

# Data Quality Evaluation (required)

The Data Quality Evaluation section should present any analyses that are needed to support the technical quality of the dataset. This section may be supported by figures and tables, as needed. *This is a required section*; authors must provide information to justify the reliability of their data. Wherever possible & appropriate, data quality evaluation should be presented in the context of data standards and quality control procedures as prescribed in the project's quality assurance planning documentation.

**Required elements for this section**

*Stock Text to include:*

The data within the data records listed above have been reviewed by staff in the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Division to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency with documented data quality standards, as well as for usability and reproducibility. The *`r dataPackageTitle`* is suitable for its intended use as of the date of processing (`r Sys.Date()`).

*Required Table*

```{r dataFlaggingTable, echo=FALSE}
flags<-c("A", "AE", "R")
def<-c("Accepted", "Accepted, estimated", "Rejected")
app<-rep("columns ending \"_flag\"", 3)
data_flags<-data.frame(flags, def, app)

knitr::kable(data_flags, caption = "**Description of data quality flags**", col.names=c("Flag", "Definition", "Useage"), format="pandoc")
```

Possible content **strongly Suggested to Include**

-   Occurrence rates or patterns in data that do not meet established standards or data quality objectives.

Possible content **may include:**

-   experiments that support or validate the data-collection procedure(s) (e.g. negative controls, or an analysis of standards to confirm measurement linearity)
-   statistical analyses of experimental error and variation
-   general discussions of any procedures used to ensure reliable and unbiased data production, such as chain of custody procedures, blinding and randomization, sample tracking systems, etc.
-   any other information needed for assessment of technical rigor by reviewers/users

Generally, this **should not include:**

-   follow-up experiments aimed at testing or supporting an interpretation of the data
-   statistical hypothesis testing (e.g. tests of statistical significance, identifying deferentially expressed genes, trend analysis, etc.)
-   exploratory computational analyses like clustering and annotation enrichment (e.g. GO analysis).

# Usage Notes (required)

The Usage Notes should contain brief instructions to assist other researchers with reuse of the data. This may include discussion of software packages (with appropriate citations) that are suitable for analysing the assay data files, suggested downstream processing steps (e.g. normalization, etc.), or tips for integrating or comparing the data records with other datasets. Authors are encouraged to provide code, programs or data-processing workflows if they may help others understand or use the data.

For studies involving privacy or safety controls on public access to the data, this section should describe in detail these controls, including how authors can apply to access the data, what criteria will be used to determine who may access the data, and any limitations on data use.

# Methods

Ideally these methods are identical to the methods listed in the metadata accompanying the data package that the DRR describes.Future versions of this template will pull directly from metadata.

The Methods should cite previous methods under use but also be detailed enough describing data production including experimental design, data acquisition assays, and any computational processing (e.g. normalization, image feature extraction) such that others can understand the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications. Cite and link to the DataStore reference for the protocol for detailed methods sufficient for reproducing the experiment or observational study. Related methods should be grouped under corresponding subheadings where possible, and methods should be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret the full study.

Specific data inputs and outputs should be explicitly cited in the text and included in the References section below, following the same [Chicago Manual of Style author-date format](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) in text. See the [USGS data citation guidelines](https://www.usgs.gov/data-management/data-citation) for examples of how to cite data in text and in the References section.

Authors are encouraged to consider creating a figure that outlines the experimental workflow(s) used to generate and analyse the data output(s) (Figure 1).

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Example general workflow to include in the methods section."}

```

### Data Collection and Sample Processing Methods (optional)

Include a description of field methods and sample processing

### Additional Data Sources (optional)

Provide descriptions (with citations) of other data sources used.

### Data Processing (required if done)

Summarize process and results of any QC processes done that manipulate, change, or qualify data.

### Code Availability (required)

For all studies using custom code in the generation or processing of datasets, a statement must be included indicating whether and how the code can be accessed and any restrictions to access. This section should also include information on the versions of any software used, if relevant, and any specific variables or parameters used to generate, test, or process the current dataset. Actual analytical code should be provided in Appendices.

# References (required)

Provide sufficient information to locate the resource. If the citation has a DOI, include the DOI at the end of the citation, including the https://doi.org prefix. If you are citing documents that have unregistered DOIs (such as a data package that you are working on concurrently) still include the DOI. Electronic resources data and data services or web sites should include the date they were accessed.

Include bibliographic information for any works cited (including the data package the DRR is describing) in the above sections, using the standard *NPS NR Publication Series* referencing style.

# Acknowledgements (optional)

The Acknowledgements should contain text acknowledging non-author contributors. Acknowledgements should be brief, and should not include thanks to anonymous referees and editors or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be acknowledged.

# Appendix A. Code Listing
In most cases, Code listing is not required. If all QA/QC and data manipulations were performed elsewhere, you should cite that code in the methods (and leave the "Listing" code chunk as the default settings: eval=FALSE and echo=FALSE). If you have developed custom scripts, you can add those to DataStore with the reference type "Script" and cite them in the DRR. Some people have developed code to perform QA/QC or data manipulation within the DRR itself. In that case, you must set the "Listing" code chunk to eval=TRUE and echo=TRUE to fully document the QA/QC process.

```{r Listing, ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

```

\pagebreak

# Appendix B. Session and Version Information
In most cases you do not need to report session info (leave the "session-info" code chunk parameters in their default state: eval=FALSE). Session and version information is only necessary if you have set the "Listing" code chunk to eval=TRUE in appendix A. In that case, change the "session-info" code chunk parameters to eval=TRUE. 

```{r session-info, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
Sys.time()
```
