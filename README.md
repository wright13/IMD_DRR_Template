# DRRs: Background

[Purpose and Scope of Data Release Reports](vignettes/PurposeAndScope.html)

This is a template is for use when drafting Data Release Reports. DRRs are created by the National Park Service and provide detailed descriptions of valuable research datasets, including the methods used to collect the data and technical analyses supporting the quality of the measurements. Data Release Reports focus on helping others reuse data rather than presenting results, testing hypotheses, or presenting new interpretations and in-depth analyses. 

# About this Template
This template contains an rmarkdown template file, default folder structure for project files, and all the necessary template files to generate an unformatted .docx file. The file will be ingested by EXstyles, converted to an .xml file and fully formatted according to NPS branding upon final publication. The goal of this process is to relieve data producers, managers, and scientists from the burden of formatting and allow them to focus primarily on content. The content should document the collection, processing, quality control, of NPS data packages and evaluate their of utility. 

This template is under active development to improve style and 508 compliance.
